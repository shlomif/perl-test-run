=head1 NAME

Test::Run::CmdLine::Plugin::BreakOnFailure - break on the first test failure.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a L<Test::Run::CmdLine> plugin that terminates the test suite after
the first failing test script. This way, you can know more quickly in case
something went wrong. 

To enable, add C<BreakOnFailure> to the C<HARNESS_PLUGINS> environment
variable and set the C<HARNESS_BREAK> environment variable to a true value.
