Test-Run-Plugin-ColorFileVerdicts

This is a Test-Run ( http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/ ) plugin
that allows one to color the verdicts of the individual test files
("ok" and "NOT OK") in terminal colors. If you want to color the summary line
look at Test-Run-Plugin-ColorSummary and Test-Run-CmdLine-Plugin-ColorSummary.
