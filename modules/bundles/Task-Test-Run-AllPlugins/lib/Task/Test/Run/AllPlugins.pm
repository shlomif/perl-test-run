=head1 NAME

Task::Test::Run::AllPlugins - Specifications for installing all the Test::Run
Plugins

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.0100';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::Run ( L<http://web-cpan.berlios.de/modules/Test-Run/> ) is an improved
harness for running test files based on the "Test Anything Protocol" 
(TAP - L<http://testanything.org/> ), which is commonly used for writing tests
for Perl code, but is otherwise universal.

Installing this Task should get you up-to-speed with Test::Run by installing
all the plugins that are available for it.

=head1 USAGE

From the CPAN or CPANPLUS shell type:

    install Task::Test::Run::AllPlugins

And follow all the depenedencies.

Afterwards, set the environment variable C<HARNESS_PLUGINS> to the following:

    export HARNESS_PLUGINS="ColorSummary ColorFileVerdicts"

Or if you wish to use the Alternate Interpreters plugin as well to:

    export HARNESS_PLUGINS="ColorSummary ColorFileVerdicts AlternateInterpreters"

Then you can use runprove to run and analyze TAP scripts (like CPAN 
modules t/*.t files) from the command line:

    runprove t/*.t

If you have written a plugin and wish it to be included in this task, don't
hesitate to contact me: L<http://www.shlomifish.org/me/contact-me/> .
