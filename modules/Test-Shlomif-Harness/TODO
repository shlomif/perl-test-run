* Test the plug-in system in T::R::CL.

* Update the documentation - currently it's mostly updated only to 
Test::Harness.

* Add an arbitrary number of leaked directories.

* Add a registry for the classes of the helper objects.

* Add a way to accumulate a list from all classes without SUPER:: and
NEXT:: games:

    package Foo;

    sub _my_params
    {
        return ["FooA", "FooB"];
    }

    package Bar;

    sub _my_params
    {
        return ["BarC", "BarD"];
    }

    package Total;

    use base 'Foo';
    use base 'Bar';

    # The paramaters are now FooA, FooB, BarC, and BarD.

* Implement a plugin system for the helper objects.

* Add the Test::Run module with some information on how to get started
with Test::Run.

* Add examples for Test::Run (not T::R::CL) under examples/ in the T::R (core)
distribution.

Bugs:

* Deal with the bug as encountered in Parrot.
