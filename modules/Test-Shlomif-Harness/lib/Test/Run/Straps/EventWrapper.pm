=head1 NAME

Test::Run::Straps::EventWrapper - a wrapper for a TAP::Parser::Result subclass
which delegates to its methods and has its own methods.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<TAP::Parser>'s C<next()> method returns a sub-class of 
L<TAP::Parser::Result>. However, we need to define our own methods
on such objects. Since we cannot inherit from all the sub-classes, we
have created this class which holds an instance of the actual events,
delegates some methods to it, and defines some of its own methods.

sub _init
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $args = shift;

    $self->_tp_result($args->{event});

    return 0;
}

=head2 $event->is_pass()

Returns whether the event can be considered a passed event. Always returns a
scalar boolean.

sub is_pass
{
    my $self = shift;

    foreach my $predicate (qw(is_ok has_todo has_skip))
    {
        if ($self->$predicate())
        {
            return 1;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

=head2 $self->get_next_test_number()

If this event is a test, then return the next expected test number. Else
return undef.

{
    my $self = shift;

    return ($self->is_test() ? ($self->number() +1 ) : undef);
