* A lot of the code here is derived from the code of Test::Harness, which is
in turn derived from the code of t/TEST in the Perl distribution which dates
back to Perl 1. It is licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.

* It is our intention to write new code and convert existing code to the MIT
Expat license ( http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php ), to allow
for maximum flexibility of the codebase, and to relieve it of ownership hands.

* One should consult the individual files for their copyrights' notices.

* Note that the other CPAN Test::Run distributions (by "Shlomi Fish" and
possibly others) were written from scratch and are fully licensed under the
MIT Expat license.
